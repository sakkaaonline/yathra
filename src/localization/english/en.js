Lord Muguga (Dandāyudhapāni3), a god of youth and beauty4, was installed on the hillock by one of the Eighteen Siddhas, Bhogar5, who is the author of the valuable literature Bhogar Elayiram and Bhogar Panneerayiram. He made this icon by solidifying nine poisonous liquid substances (nava basana) by a peculiar chemical process which is unknown to present-day chemists. The icon has a divine feature of attracting lakhs and lakhs of devotees from all parts of the country. The worship of Muruka has a hoary antiquity. He is praised in Cankam literature, especially in Tirumurugattruppadai6. It mentions Palani as Avinankudi7 a place where goddess Mahalakshmi, Kamadenu, Indra and other deities worshipped Lord Muruka. By following this divine tradition people worship Lord Muruka in the hillock for prosperity in this mundane life as well as to realise the secrets of the other world.
